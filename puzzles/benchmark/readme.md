# Benchmark Puzzles

This directory contains the actual benchmark puzzle sets used to evaluate AI models and participants.

The puzzle files are not included in the public repository to maintain the integrity of the benchmark. 

When deploying, these files are pulled from a private repository.

To test the system locally, please refer to the puzzles in the `examples` directory.
